# Daily Diary
 Initial thoughts were to make an app that would act as a daily journal along with a daily goal tracker and visualization. 
 I have gone through multiple iterations of this idea, and have settled on building it using layerd architecture. 

## To Run
 At the moment it does not run with a UI. It only has the business end of data access and month/day models. 
 To interact with the current code, copy the following modules from journal/, then you can call the classes:
 - data_access.py
 - journal_controller.py
 - models.py
 - app_logger.py
 - config.py
