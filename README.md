# Daily Diary
 Initial thoughts were to make an app that would act as a daily journal along with a daily goal tracker and visualization. 
 I have gone through multiple iterations of this idea, and have settled on building it using layerd architecture. 

## To Run
 copy journal_main.py and the needed dependencies:
  - controllers/
  - data_access/
  - models/
  - ui/
  - utils/
  - config.py
